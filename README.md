# # Flutter Counter Example Test
This repository contains a simple Flutter app that demonstrates how to write widget tests using the flutter_test package. The app consists of a counter that the user can increment or decrement by tapping buttons, and a reset button that sets the counter back to zero.

# Getting started
To get started with this app, clone the repository and run flutter run in the project directory.
The app includes widget tests that test the behavior of the counter. To run the tests, use the flutter test command in the project directory.

# Unit tests
The unit tests are located in the test directory. They test the behavior of the LoginViewModel class

# Widget tests
The widget tests are located in the test directory. They test the behavior of the counter widget by simulating user interactions and verifying that the counter value is updated correctly. The tests also verify that the reset button sets the counter back to zero.

# Test coverage
The app also includes code coverage reports generated by the flutter test --coverage command. To view the coverage reports, open the coverage/lcov-report/index.html file in a web browser. The coverage reports show which lines of code were executed during the tests and which lines were not executed.
